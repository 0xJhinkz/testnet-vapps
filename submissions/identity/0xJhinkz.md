## Developer

* **Name**: Jhinkz
* **GitHub**: [@0xJhinkz](https://github.com/0xJhinkz)
* **Discord**: 0xm3th
* **Experience**: Builder and open-source contributor in the Web3 space, focusing on blockchain infrastructure, smart contracts, and decentralized systems. My projects revolve around reliability, security, and building accessible dApp ecosystems. I’ve worked on EVM-based tooling, DeFi integrations, and infrastructure-level components that prioritize transparency and performance.

## Project

### Name & Category

* **Project**: Queens vApp
* **Category**: Identity

### Description

Queens vApp addresses the **fragmentation of digital identity** across Web3 ecosystems. Users currently juggle multiple identities and verification methods that compromise privacy and trust. This vApp introduces a **self-sovereign identity layer** powered by the Soundness Layer (SL).

With Queens vApp, users can securely **create, verify, and manage digital identities** without relying on centralized gatekeepers. It’s designed for cross-platform interoperability, privacy preservation, and developer-friendly integration into dApps.

### SL Integration

The vApp integrates the **Soundness Layer** to enable:

* **Zero-knowledge proof-based verification**, giving users privacy-preserving trust guarantees
* **Tamper-resistant record-keeping**, ensuring verifiable and immutable credential histories
* **Cross-dApp interoperability**, allowing one portable identity across ecosystems
* **Efficient verification flows**, lowering gas and operational costs

## Technical

### Architecture

* **Frontend**: React / Next.js for user identity dashboards
* **Backend**: Node.js (API) + Rust (core verification engine)
* **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + EVM chain integration
* **Storage**: IPFS / WALRUS for encrypted credential storage

### Features

1. Decentralized identity creation & lifecycle management
2. Cross-dApp identity verification backed by SL proofs
3. Selective disclosure of credentials using zero-knowledge primitives

---

## Timeline

### PoC (2–4 weeks)

* [ ] Implement base identity creation flow
* [ ] SL integration for proof requests
* [ ] Minimal UI for wallet & ID setup

### MVP (4–8 weeks)

* [ ] Full dashboard for identity/credential management
* [ ] Cross-dApp interoperability demos
* [ ] Deployment + community feedback cycle

---

## Innovation

Queens vApp focuses on **user-first decentralized identity**. Instead of handing control to platforms, the vApp empowers individuals with portable, verifiable, and private credentials. By leveraging SL’s cryptographic guarantees, it makes decentralized identity **practical, scalable, and developer-friendly**.

This aligns with my broader work on building **Web3 infrastructure and developer tools** — making ecosystems secure, modular, and open.
