## Project

### Name & Category

* **Project**: Jhinkz vApp
* **Category**: identity

### Description

Jhinkz vApp is designed to simplify **decentralized identity management**. Today, users face fragmented identity systems, making it difficult to manage trust, privacy, and verification across multiple platforms. This vApp introduces a **self-sovereign identity framework** built on top of the Soundness Layer (SL), allowing users to create, verify, and manage their identity securely. By decentralizing verification, the project reduces reliance on centralized entities, enhances privacy, and streamlines onboarding across applications.

### SL Integration

The project will incorporate **Soundness Layer (SL)** to enable:

* **Proof-based identity verification** using zero-knowledge proofs
* **Immutable record-keeping** to ensure transparent, tamper-resistant identity data
* **Cross-dApp interoperability**, so users maintain one identity across different ecosystems
* **Lightweight and efficient verification**, reducing costs for both users and developers

## Technical

### Architecture

The application will be structured as follows:

* **Frontend**: User-facing dashboard for creating and managing decentralized identities
* **Backend**: Verification engine and APIs for proof requests
* **Soundness Layer integration**: Handles on-chain proof verification and consistency
* **Storage**: Distributed storage (IPFS/WALRUS) for encrypted credentials

### Stack

* **Frontend**: React / Next.js
* **Backend**: Node.js / Rust
* **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + EVM-based chain
* **Storage**: WALRUS / IPFS

### Features

1. Decentralized identity creation and lifecycle management
2. Interoperability with other dApps via SL-backed proofs
3. Privacy-focused credential sharing with zero-knowledge proof support

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)

* [ ] Implement identity creation flow
* [ ] Integrate Soundness Layer for identity proofs
* [ ] Develop initial UI for wallet and identity management

### MVP (4-8 weeks)

* [ ] Full-featured dashboard with credential controls
* [ ] Enable interoperability with multiple dApps
* [ ] Production-ready deployment and user testing feedback loop

## Innovation

Jhinkz vApp is built with the idea of **user-first digital identity**. Instead of relying on central intermediaries, it gives individuals full ownership and control over their identity while ensuring privacy and portability. With SL's cryptographic guarantees, the project makes decentralized identity practical, scalable, and easy to adopt for both users and developers.
